# PAC File Repository

This repository contains the PAC file and related resources for the dynamic proxy configuration of the SYNically-ACKward organization. The PAC file is used to determine the appropriate proxy server for different URLs and provide flexible network access for employees.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to showcase the best practices and techniques for managing and maintaining PAC files in a complex network environment. It serves as a reference implementation for administrators and network engineers who are responsible for deploying and maintaining PAC files within their organization.

## Contents

- `proxy.pac`: The main PAC file that contains the logic for proxy server selection based on URL patterns and response time measurements.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the repository and its purpose.
- `resources/`: A directory containing additional resources and scripts related to PAC file management, testing, and automation.

## Usage

To use the PAC file in your network environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Update the PAC file (`proxy.pac`) with the appropriate proxy server configurations, bypass list, and any custom logic required for your organization.
3. Deploy the PAC file to your network infrastructure, ensuring that it is accessible to client devices.
4. Configure the client devices (e.g., browsers) to use the PAC file for proxy configuration. This can be done through group policies, browser settings, or other configuration management tools.
5. Test and monitor the PAC file deployment to ensure proper functionality and performance.
